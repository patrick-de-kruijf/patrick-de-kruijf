# 👋 Working with Patrick (he/him)
This page is intended to help others understand what it might be like to work with me, especially people who haven’t worked with me before. 

## 🕤 Time zone and working hours
- My working days are monday-friday
- I work remote between 08.00 - 18:00 (Amsterdam time) from home and Xpirit HQ (NL)
- I do not check email, work, or respond to work-related messages on days off, holidays, evenings and the weekends.

## 📫 Communication preferences
<!--
Communicate. If there's a problem or you're blocked on something, please bring it up. I'll generally interpret silence as "everything's fine".
- **I prefer to communicate via calls for longer dialogs** (phone, slack or teams will do) I highly dislike phone calls, because I need time to process information and feel rushed to repsond.
- **Need me to respond quickly?** send me a text message (only call if something is on fire 🔥).
- **I don’t have unscheduled meetings**. My weeks are packed with training, workshops and customer work. I protect my time and manage my energy levels: In order to do my best work (creating scripts, workshops, etc), I need long stretches of time to think and focus. Unscheduled calls are interruptions for me.
-->

## 💻 My working style
<!--
- **I like explicit tasks.** I’m better at helping when I have a good idea of what you need. “Take a look” is less helpful than “I’m looking for feedback on X and Y, by end of month”.
- **Transparency is very important to me.** Please work with a low level of shame, no ego, and be open to criticism.
- **If I disagree with you, I may try to steer you down a different path.** But me disagreeing with you doesn’t mean that you’re doing something wrong.
- **Please do not take offense to periods of silence.** I prefer long, uninterrupted windows of time to work. I disable all notifications on my laptop and my phone. This allows me to focus deeply on one task at a time, which is a more efficient way of working than attempting to multitask.
- **I need recovery time after social events.** After trainings and workshops I go offline to recover from a social hangover and focus on individual work.
- **I appreciate “I don’t know” as an answer.** 
-->

## 🙏 Respect
<!--
- **I take action items really seriously** and I expect you to know what yours are, when they are due, and get them done. I don’t like chasing them but I do notice when things slip, it’s fine to renegotiate deadlines but I’ll be annoyed if it’s the day after the deadline.
- **I am generally clear-minded and explicit about my priorities.** My job is to achieve my priorities. Your job is to achieve your priorities. Our time together, in any context, is best spent at the intersection of our respective priorities. I therefore very much appreciate knowing what your priorities are when we talk.

## What I assume about others
<!--
- ❤️ Positive intent, open to feedback and willingness to learn.
- 💜 You’ll ask for my input and help if it’s needed.
- 💙 You do your best effort to be inclusive when communicating with me and my team.
- 💚 You have more going on than the one thing we're discussing.
- 💛 Everyone is likely fighting a battle I know nothing about. 
-->

## I love working with people who… 
<!--
- know their topic and ask questions when they don't know.
- proactively deal with the boring, difficult, uncomfortable work. 
- only need to be told something once. 
-->
