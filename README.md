# 👋 Working with Patrick (he/him)
This page is intended to help others understand what it might be like to work with me, especially people who haven’t worked with me before. 

## 🕤 Time zone and working hours
- My working days are monday-friday
- I work remote between 08.00 - 18:00 (Amsterdam time) from home and Xpirit HQ (NL)
- I do not check email, work, or respond to work-related messages on days off, holidays, evenings and the weekends.

## 📫 Communication preferences
Open, honest and direct communication works best for and with me. If there is something that you need from me, just ask for it. I generally do not _to the point_ in my communication. If you do not ask for more information or help, I assume you are up-to-date and know enough.
- **I prefer to communicate via calls for dialogs** (phone, slack or teams will do) 
- **I might tell you that I do have the time or energy at this moment** If I tell you this, this is nothing personal, I just need to _make room in my head_ first 
- **If I do not pickup if you call, try sending me a message** I will make sure to call you back as soon as possible. GIving context in the message will help me get an answer quicker for you

## 💻 My working style
- **I am multitasking a lot** While waiting on actions to complete I tend to work on something else in the meantime
- **I quickly evaluate consequences during a conversation and share concerns** This could be picked up as 'pessimistic', but I do this with good/positive intent
- **I remember a lot of details about a lot of things** This might come across as if I know everything and more than others, but this it not always true 
- **I need time to recharge after long or intense meetings and interactions** 
- **I feel responsible for the customers that I help and team I work for** 
- **I generally do not assume anything and will verify**

## 🙏 Respect
- **I treat others like I want to be treated myself** 
- **I accept making mistakes and want to help others to learn and expect others to do the same with me**

## What I assume about others
- You will ask help if you need it
- You ask for clarification if something is not clear
- You might have something going on that I do not know about
- You speak up and stand up for yourself and your colleagues

## I love working with people who… 
- Communicate 
- Learn quick
- Know their skill levels
- Trust, but verify
- Speak up and stand up

## Hobbies & Interests
- 🏍️ Riding my motorcycle
- 🌴 Trips with my family
- 🏎️ Formula 1
- 🍔 BBQ'ing
